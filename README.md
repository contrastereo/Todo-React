# Todo-React
This is a Todo App created with React
You can see it live in: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/contrastereo/Todo-React/

# Functionality
When tasks are written in the text input, press the "Go!" button and the value will be placed in the local storage as object with an unique id, the tasks later will be rendered in the "unfinished tasks" list, and when clicked the tasks status will be changed (by default they are given a status when created) and they will be placed in the "finished tasks" list.

# Future Additions
- Input sensibility 
  -The text input should show character length restrictions
